SoldierSpect is basically a suit, mainly designed for military personnel. It constitutes of various sensors like XD-58C Heart rate sensor, MQ-135 Air Quality Sensor and DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor. 
They're connected to the nodeMCU, to collectively send data to a web server and an application.

We've integrated a GSM module to send a message to the medic to send help or to the high rank officers, to send more force(if required).

SoldierSpect_Arduino contains the code to link Arduino with the GSM module.
SoldierSpect_nodeMCU contains the code to link all the sensors collectively and send the data to the app and the webserver.
Smart jacket for army personals
This is an additional layer of security to what security measures they already have.
Human life is valuable than anything else, just like our national treasure.
If we talk about Pulwama attack they died and there was nothing we could do about it.
Coming to making smart decisions this is where our product stands out.
It is economical, and the design further can be implemented to suit the standard protocols.
This will be embedded inside a 2 layered jacket of bulletproof vests.
This all data can be displayed on a mobile application and a web application.

What it does is to provide the vital dynamics of personals for medical support.

By vital sensor I mean the temperature, respiratory rate, body temperature, air pressure.
Additionally when  In need of help they can press the sos button and get the help.
